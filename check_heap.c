 *
 *      - Ensure that the free block list is in the order you expect it to be in.
 *        As an example, if you maintain the free list in memory-address order,
 *        lowest address first, ensure that memory addresses strictly ascend as you
 *        traverse the free list.
 *
 *      - Check if any free memory_blocks overlap with each other. 
 *
 *      - Ensure that each memory_block is aligned. 
 * 
 * Should return 0 if the heap is still consistent, otherwise return a non-zero
 * return code. Asserts are also a useful tool here.
